# Zephyr.js Examples

These examples define the target API and behavior for Zephyr.js. The framework will be built to make these examples work.

## Example Structure

Each example is a complete, working application that demonstrates Zephyr.js features:

1. **Basic Counter** - Simple reactive counter with increment/decrement
2. **Rectangle** - Object reactivity with property access and modification
3. **Todo List** - Full CRUD todo application with reactive state
4. **Multi-Page App** - Multiple routes with navigation
5. **Blog Post** - Dynamic route with parameters

## Running Examples

Once Zephyr.js is implemented, run examples with:

```bash
cd examples/basic-counter
bun run server.ts
```

## Development Approach

These examples serve as:
- **API Specification** - They define how Zephyr.js should work
- **Test Cases** - They must all work correctly
- **Documentation** - They show real-world usage patterns

Build Zephyr.js to make these examples work!
